# DA5300_DSA_Lab_IITM

Hi, I'm Atharva and I am attending IIT Madras. I am enrolled in DA5300 - Data Structures and Algorithms for Data Science. This class has a lab component in which we do exercises (mainly) in python.

This repository made is for keeping notes and records of all lab sessions of DA5300. The code will mostly be in jupyter notebooks and the notebooks will enumerate the session number.
